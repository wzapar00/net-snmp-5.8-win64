# net-snmp-5.8-win64 executables compiled with Active State Perl, Visual Studio 2015, and OpenSSL 1.1.1d.

1.  Clone the git repo and copy the windows executables to your local Windows OS.
2.  Open a Command Prompt and cd to the directory where the executables are located.
3.  Execute them directly from the command prompt.  (snmpwalk.exe, snmpset.exe, i.e).
4.  Quick Note, most Windows Antivirus's will see the executables as malware.  They are NOT.  You can safely override the quarantined files in your antivirus software.
